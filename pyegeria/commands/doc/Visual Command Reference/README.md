# README for the Visual Command Reference

The Visual Command Reference provides screenshots for every `hey_egeria` **show** command. As we continue to 
enhance and extend these commands, each image (and file) is time-stamped. The screenshots are organized in folders
following the **hey_egeria** menu structure. 

A summary reference is provided in [Visual Reference Summary](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-python/tree/main/pyegeria/commands/doc/Visual%20Command%20Reference/)
